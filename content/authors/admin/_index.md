Hi! Iâ€™m Muhsin. I currently work as a researcher at the Central Bank of Turkey. I graduated in 2018 with Master of Science in Economics from Middle East Technical University. My research interests are financial economics and macroeconomics and I also occasionally deal with data science using different platforms.
