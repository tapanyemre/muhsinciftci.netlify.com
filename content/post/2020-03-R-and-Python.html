<p>Two most influential programming languages for machine learning, data science and visualization are Python and R. And there has been a tough competition between the two. Both are great and has their own superiority over each other. However, thanks to the R <code>reticulate</code> package it is now possible to work on both languages at the same time. As a text editor, RStudio is a well-suited environment to work on both. In this post I want to share shortly how to do so.</p>
<div id="r-environment" class="section level1">
<h1>R Environment</h1>
<p>Lets load the regular libraries in R</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = TRUE, cache = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>After that we use the library <code>reticulate</code> and <code>use_condaenv("r-reticulate")</code>. These two functions let us use R and python together and work on the same data set.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
use_condaenv(&quot;r-reticulate&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>For the first round, we load the <code>woolridge</code> data set. This data set are mostly used for labor economics. Here we look at the relationship between education, wages and experience.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>we &lt;- wooldridge::wage1

p1 &lt;- we%&gt;%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(educ, lwage))+
  geom_smooth(aes(educ, lwage))+
  labs(caption = &quot;Source: Woolridge Data Set&quot;)

p2 &lt;- we%&gt;%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(exper, lwage))+
  geom_smooth(aes(exper, lwage))+
  labs(caption = &quot;Source: Woolridge Data Set&quot;)

p1 + p2</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="python-environment" class="section level1">
<h1>Python Environment</h1>
<p>First we load python libraries, and their styles.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use(&#39;seaborn&#39;)</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>An important point to mention is that when we use the data in python that we already used in R we simply call it by <code>r.dataset</code> . In the opposite case (when we use data in R that we already prepared in python), we use the option <code>py$dataset</code> . This two functions make the life much easier than we think.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="python"><code>we_py = r.we

plt.subplot(2,1,1)
plt.scatter(we_py[&#39;educ&#39;], we_py[&#39;lwage&#39;])
plt.xlabel(&#39;Education&#39;)
plt.ylabel(&#39;Log Wage&#39;)

plt.subplot(2,1,2)
plt.scatter(we_py[&#39;exper&#39;], we_py[&#39;lwage&#39;])
plt.xlabel(&#39;Experience&#39;)
plt.ylabel(&#39;Log Wage&#39;)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-R-and-Python_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<div id="result" class="section level2">
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>We do not necessarily have to work on different languages and miss on the great functionality provided by both languages. Fortunately, <code>reticulate</code> package in R solves the problem. Now we are able to benefit from both python and R for our research.</p>
