title: 'A Basic Gibbs Sampler'
---


`Gibbs Sampler`, which is a specific case of `MH algorithm`, allows us to come up with values of ($\beta$, $\Sigma$) from joint distributions. Assuming that we have starting values for $\beta$ and $\Sigma$, and call them  $\beta^0$ and $\Sigma^0$. With those we will sample from the density of one element of parameter vector, conditional on the value of the other element sampled in the previous iteration. Thus the sampler will follow a recursive procedure. At the end we need to remove the effects of initial draws, which we call `burn-in` period. Lets take a bivariate example for Normal Distribution for which say we have $X$ is distributed as $N(0, \Sigma)$ and $\rho$ stands for the cross correlation between $x_1$ and $x_2$. The following code of [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) will mimic this recursive procedure.
